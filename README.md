# ArduinoMidiSequencer

This is a simple Midi sequencer that allows you to set 2 sequences of up to 6 notes each, and then select the pattern they should be looped in. EG: 11112222 or 11221122, etc.

It is controlled by two rotary encoders, one to select the setting, the other to adjust the value of that setting.

It allows the timing (and pause) of each note to be adjusted, as well as an overal timing. It also allows the MIDI channel to be set.
